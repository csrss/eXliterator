# eXliterator

An early project, application that can transliterate different windows. What it means, you may ask. Transliteration is 
when you type some word in source language, and then letters which you type, are replaced with letters in target language. 
This application designed to transliterate latin written letters to a cyrilic letters. So for instance, you may launch 
notepad.exe, notepad's name will be then displayed in eXliterator window. You then switch transliteration on it, and then, 
everything what you will be typing in this notepad's window, will be transliterated. For instance, if type in latin: "privet", 
what will be written in notepad, is: "привет".

Another function, which app has, is dictionary. You can add your own translations as well as fetch online translations.

I cannot tell if translation works, - it was so long ago I have written this app. Transliteration should work. Application 
is written in pure C/C++, UI is Win32 (GdiPlus) - no 3rd party libs used.

Yes, buttons have glowing effect and they are transparent :)
